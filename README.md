# BasicUIElements

This module serves a similar purpose to BasicCommons except that it holds the visual elements.
Assets, reusable nibs, buttons, colors, fonts are defined and standardized here.
This enforces the themes of the UI team.  For example, no team should come up with their own original color.  Swiftlint can show a compile time warning if they try.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

BasicUIElements is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'BasicUIElements'
```
